# Spotted
What helps any normal human being do their tasks you may ask? yup. MUSIC. Thats why i decided to make a spotify dupe, to help us all make our tasks more fun (following #siege's prep week 2 recommended theme)

you can add music if you're an artist (artist account) i was too lazy to add music so i left that for you (the user), the genre boxes will probably be empty so please add music !

you can also create playlists AND (i don't know how i did it but) I FINALLY MADE A WEBSITE RESPONSIVE (i despise css)

so start listening now on Spotted !
